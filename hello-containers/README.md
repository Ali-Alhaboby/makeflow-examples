Hello, World! Workflow with Containers Example
----------------------

This directory contains the materials needed to construct a "Hello, World!"
workflow with containers. The idea behind this example is to demonstrate how
a user can integrate containers into a workflow by specifying the container's
inputs as an input file, and how to run them

To construct a makeflow, simply run the `make.py` program to construct a dummy Makeflow file.

Here are the options for it:

```
Creation tool for "hello, world!" container makeflow maker.
Usage: python make.py [ARGS]
-h,--help          Print this Help
-d,--docker        Specify Docker Image
-s,--singularity   Specify Singularity Image
```
